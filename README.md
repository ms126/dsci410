## RQs: 
The questions I am interested in answering are: How do demographics differ over time of day, day of the week, and over season? & How does the volume of CAHOOTS calls vary over time of day, day of the week, and over season? I chose to answer these questions because they provide answers as to when CAHOOTS provides the most help, and who they are helping. I want to see if there is a correlation between call times and demographics, or if there are any patterns that I can seek out which will help CAHOOTS in the future.
