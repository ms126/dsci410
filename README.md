## Overview:
This project offers a comprehensive overview of the CAHOOTS call log data, providing detailed insights into the demographics and trends within the data. By comparing the findings with census data, we can better understand the population served by CAHOOTS and identify areas for potential improvement in service delivery.

## RQs: 
The questions I am interested in answering are: How do demographics differ over time of day, day of the week, and over season? & How does the volume of CAHOOTS calls vary over time of day, day of the week, and over season? I chose to answer these questions because they provide answers as to when CAHOOTS provides the most help, and who they are helping. I want to see if there is a correlation between call times and demographics, or if there are any patterns that I can seek out which will help CAHOOTS in the future.
